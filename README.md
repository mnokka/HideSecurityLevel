# HideSecurityLevel
Hiding Security Level field for all but admin group

Uses Jira Banner to inject JavaScript code to hide Structure widget from Jira Issue view


Notes:
ScriptRunner Web resources gives possibility to inject javascript "more elegantly" but if seems to break issue view single issue selection

Script runner Behaviours gives posibility only 
1) to hide View screen "Change Security Level functionality". But does not hide whole custom field
2) Hide Edit screen Securtiy Level field
